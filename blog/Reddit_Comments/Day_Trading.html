As a trader I look for specific patterns which I have found repeat day in and day out. When these patterns occur I take a position and I set specific risk parameters. In general I always try to day trade closing positions by the end of the day. So basically a stock has to do what I expect in a given time period. If it doesn't meaning it goes no place or goes against me, I have a set stop loss and I exit the stock for a predictable loss which falls within my predefined risk parameters. I don't care what happens after I get stopped out. All I care is to protect my trading capital. No specific trade is important. Only the combined amount of trades over several months or years is what I care about.

I did exactly that. Basically the catch is that over time you accumulate positions that are all moderately under water. Ie you run out of capital for day trading due to all the bag holding.<br>
Itâ€™s not a bad approach but has a limited lifespan in a sense

Alright so I don't day trade but I have been swing trading for a little over a year now so hopefully I can give you a decent answer to your questions. The goal of a swing trader and the goal of a long term investor are completely different for starters. A long term investor's thesis on a particular stock, ETF, commodity, or whatever they are investing in is that in ____ years the stock will be worth more than it is today, usually the time frame is at least 5+ years. And investors base this hypothesis almost purely on fundamental analysis like how is the management, what is the company's long term growth strategy, do they have a monopoly or competitive advantage over other companies. Whereas a swing trader typically bases their trades purely on technical analysis which takes into account price and volume patterns, measures of volatility, whether a stock is oversold or overbought, support and resistance levels, bollinger bands, so on and so forth. So therefore a swing trader's thesis has nothing to do with the company 5+ years down the line, maybe the company will be bankrupt in 5 years, they don't care, they interpret the charts a data to form their thesis. In simple cases their thesis is one of two things, will this stock be worth more than it is currently in 1-50 days, or will it be worth less than it is currently in 1-50 days. Time frames vary based on the individual and the strategy but typically are a minimum of a day or two and usually don't last longer than a month or so. For me I'd say my median holding period for a position is roughly 5-10 trading days, or 1-2 weeks.

To offer insight on your other question of "why don't traders just hold a position even if it fails to return a profit short term" is actually a more layered and complicated question than it would initially seem. A few reasons why I do not do this and why I'm sure many other traders also do not is because of the concept of discipline, trading psychology, use of capital, and time horizons. A disciplined trader sets predefined stop losses and profit targets and sticks to them no matter what. This is incredibly key to stay in the game long term, it will be hard to find a seasoned career trader that trades on emotions because any trader that does will most likely lose their shirt and lose it fast. Psychology falls in line with discipline, the hardest part of trading is the psychology behind it, not falling victim to biases (or minimizing the risks your own biases cause by trying to be aware that you have them), not being emotional in trades, never "falling in love" with a stock or position, and so on. And the use of capital is another huge one, if you bought a stock as it bounces off a support and you think it's going to make an upwards move but it doesn't and instead breaks through the support, you will have to sell anyways because you are disciplined and have a stop loss, but you will also not want to sit in a position you no longer have a thesis for why it will go up short term, and therefore your money can most likely be better off in another position. And if you can't find anything else that meets your predefined rigid trading criteria then you just hold cash until something does. Because capital is finite but opportunities are infinite.

Hope this offers some insight and answers a few of your questions!
