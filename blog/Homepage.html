It's Friday. I'm on the bus headed to Vancouver and I'm doing some blogging. Currently working on my chart feed and making great progress. It started out as a tool for myself and I took a week to develop it into something fun and useful for the whole community.
</p>

<p>
I've got a few more things to configure but I want to launch it by Sunday. On Monday I want to have it running on my desktop at home for constant uptime and infinite updating.

Tried out using a lower stop loss for 4 trades, 13-10. Stop loss  somewhere between 1~2% range. This led to 3 losses and one win. The purpose of the small stop loss was to get out quickly of bad trades and focus on the good ones. There was one winner, Coindash for a 5%. All together the 3 losses combine to 3-4% and cancels out the gain. 
</p>

<p>
With this strategy you would have to be looking for big winners, and simultaneously cutting off anything else. Say you had a few coins you expected to go 12% and would exit if any of them dropped 1%. You would need this large winner to make up for the fact that you left the other trades so quickly. 
</p>

<p>
So because I am not generally looking for huge gain percentages, and prefer to let the trades swing naturally. I will be returning to using the stop loss like I did with my earlier trades #1 - #9. In the 5% range.
