Two strats I will share with you. Don't mistake simplicity for lack of utility.
</p>

<p>
First, understand that compound interest can turn seemingly trivial gains into massive ones with consistency and a bull market. Bears will be harder with day trading.
</p>

<p>
Okay, two strategies. Both depend on high volatility. I trade crypto because there are no laws for day trading minimums and because volatility is high. I trade almost exclusively ETH but will swing trade others.
</p>

<p>
Strategy 1: Level 2s. Look at the order books. Learn how the topography of the buy/sell orders can carve out a potential path for brief spikes (I'm talking .5 - 1.5%; if you think those gains are dumb, compound a 1% gain x amount of times.) Learn to spot fake sell/buy walls from manipulators. In a bull market you can learn without stop lossing but this is a huge risk. Don't put in more than you're willing to lose.
</p>

<p>
Strategy 2: Learn the rhythms of the market. Watch ceilings and floors. If something hits a floor for a second time, and sentiment hasn't changed, ride that sucker up. I literally bought ETH yesterday a $911 because that was the second time it hit that $910 floor in the last day or two. I then sold at $950. That was for literally zero effort and a day of waiting. You do the math.
</p>

<p>
With all of these, never market buy. Set limit orders and commit unless new information arises
</p>

 &gt;&gt;8507006 knowing how to call tops and bottoms is the biggest thing.  Trade with like $25 until you learn the hard way (there is no other way) and then hope you dont fuck up 
</p>

<p>
 &gt;&gt;8504384 Hello newfriend Enjoy that meme but shit doesn't work like that First off the coin you happen to have will only pump on certain days.  Most days it will be stagnant and not move enough to make a trade So pulling 2percent gains literally every day is not at all likely , near impossibleEspecially because you would be trading your whole stack Let's say you found a nice 5 percent raiseYay I sold the top! Now just buy the dipThere are times a coin barely comes down and keeps going upwards.  If you happened to sell before a strong uptrend you are completely fuckedThose 20 good trades you made will all put you in negative from one bad trade I make trades every few days.  I put my orders in and can leave the pc and usually after a few days my buy or sell will hit However as I explained there are times the coin goes on an uptrend and you thought you sold the top but now you have to buy in higher than you sold because it hasn't dipped 
</p>

 &gt;&gt;8505877 &gt;&gt;8506067 In situations like this your can make more money when BTC crashing than you can chasing moon missions if you know what you're doing, just by trading BTC, no need to touch altcoins. Why are you missing out on these gains? BitMEX (the &amp;quot;mex&amp;quot; stands for Mercatile Exchange) is the only crypto exchange in the world that offers 100X leverage (but it's not because you can that you must, go small and work your way up). Let me explain what this means.  So lets say you were to have shorted (placed a sell order) for BTC at $10 000.  Let's also say you only have . 1 BTC to trade with, or $1 000 worth.  With . 1 BTC at x10 leverage you can sell 1 BTC.  Then for every dollar BTC goes down, your position is worth $1 more.  Say BTC goes to $8 000, if you close your position you then get the difference which is $2 000 in profit paid to you in BTC, that's a 200% profitI would suggest you learn TA before you start trading.  You can train using their testnet (free). You want a moon mission? BitMEX is your moon mission. Euros and others can sign up but US users are banned (just sign up with a proxy and then you can login from a US IP with no questions asked).  If you're going to sign up use my reference code, using a reference code gives you a %10 discount in fees.  May not sound like much but it's saved me hundred of dollars in the past weeks: <a href="https://www" title="https://www" class="https">https://www</a>. bitmex. com/register/toYHiE - Interface is amazing with professional grade advanced order types- Liquidity it offers is completely unmatched, it's the biggest exchange volume wise: <a href="https://coinmarketcap" title="https://coinmarketcap" class="https">https://coinmarketcap</a>. com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/no-fees/ - BTC deposits take less than 10 minutes: just 1 confirmation from the network needed- Never down, no shady flash crashes caused by website being down like Poloniex does
