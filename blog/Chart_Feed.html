<p>
The chart feed is a useful tool I wanted to create for day traders. Originally I created it for myself but was compelled to share it online after recieving positive critique and requests to do so. My greater goal with the project is to create a community of cryptocurrenecy traders. While creating pillar content and resources that the entire community can benefit from. The way I see it, the more people who learn and enter the game, the more successful we will all be with this fun new market.
</p>

<p>
I hope that people find it useful and interesting enough to visit it more than a couple times a week. I know the tool is useful and I hope the extra entertainment modules I've added to spice up the feed, do not discourage anyone. If you have any suggestions to other content to display in the feed, please leave a comment. 
</p>

<p>
This is all an attempt to learn and help others learn successful swing trading using intuition, buying signals, technical analysis and discipline.
</p>

<p>
If that's interesting to you. Make sure you hang around and be part of a brand new community.
