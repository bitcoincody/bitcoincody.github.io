Notes for research and resources for myself and you!
</p>

<p>
&gt;&gt;I recommend books on psychology like the Disciplined Trader. I also suggest a basic book on technical analysis like Technical analysis of stock trends 10th edition. Very few books will teach you how to trade but you can get information which can help you to learn what a trader needs to know to develop their own trading system.
