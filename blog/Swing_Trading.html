Some notes I've gathered about Swing Trading
</p>

<p>
 &gt;&gt;8505958 Obviously not if you think 1% a day is outrageous.  I've been scalping and swinging omg and nav the last few days, trading stack increased 8%, I aim for 12% a month, idc about catching pump and dumps because I can consistently make gains I am happy with 1% is definitely not insane. . .  especially not in a market like this.  It doesn't matter bull market or not, any volatility is good volatility.  
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
 &gt;&gt;8504820 retarded analogy.  and yes 2% a day on average is reasonable if are an experienced and consistent trader in a market this volatile.  of course this isn't plausible in the long term because of &gt;&gt;8504579 .  you can however make 2% a day on a fixed amount like 10k for $200 a day on average.  
</p>

<h3>The market is always creating higher highs and lower lows.</h3>

<p>
And because of this, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) takes hold of may people new to crypto trading. If something is at the highest point its ever been before, remember the following: THERE WILL BE A POINT WHERE IT COMES DOWN. A low will come, don't jump in head first buying at a high. Wait for a retraction, gauge the assets volume, find out why its retracted, learn some technical analysis and pick and entry point, and make an educated decision. If your entry point isnt reached, then you need to hone your entries. But remember that the coin may have peaked and it may not go higher for a long time. It may only retract for a few hours, it may remain at that price for months or years.
</p>

<p>
Example: I decided diversify my portfolio a little more, choosing to sell some of my Ripple and buy into REQ a few days ago. REQ has been coming off of a high, and I heed my own advice, and never bought at the high. Low and behold, it retracted yesterday and today. I saw my buying opportunity, set my entry and waited. Entry triggered! Oh no! Its still dropping! And it continued to drop by a 15%. What did I do? I let it be. I walked away. And as of right now, I'm up 41% on that trade.
</p>

<h3>Alright so I don't day trade.</h3>

<p>
But I have been swing trading for a little over a year now so hopefully I can give you a decent answer to your questions. The goal of a swing trader and the goal of a long term investor are completely different for starters. A long term investor's thesis on a particular stock, ETF, commodity, or whatever they are investing in is that in ____ years the stock will be worth more than it is today, usually the time frame is at least 5+ years. And investors base this hypothesis almost purely on fundamental analysis like how is the management, what is the company's long term growth strategy, do they have a monopoly or competitive advantage over other companies. Whereas a swing trader typically bases their trades purely on technical analysis which takes into account price and volume patterns, measures of volatility, whether a stock is oversold or overbought, support and resistance levels, bollinger bands, so on and so forth. So therefore a swing trader's thesis has nothing to do with the company 5+ years down the line, maybe the company will be bankrupt in 5 years, they don't care, they interpret the charts a data to form their thesis. In simple cases their thesis is one of two things, will this stock be worth more than it is currently in 1-50 days, or will it be worth less than it is currently in 1-50 days. Time frames vary based on the individual and the strategy but typically are a minimum of a day or two and usually don't last longer than a month or so. For me I'd say my median holding period for a position is roughly 5-10 trading days, or 1-2 weeks.
</p>

<p>
To offer insight on your other question of "why don't traders just hold a position even if it fails to return a profit short term" is actually a more layered and complicated question than it would initially seem. A few reasons why I do not do this and why I'm sure many other traders also do not is because of the concept of discipline, trading psychology, use of capital, and time horizons. A disciplined trader sets predefined stop losses and profit targets and sticks to them no matter what. This is incredibly key to stay in the game long term, it will be hard to find a seasoned career trader that trades on emotions because any trader that does will most likely lose their shirt and lose it fast. Psychology falls in line with discipline, the hardest part of trading is the psychology behind it, not falling victim to biases (or minimizing the risks your own biases cause by trying to be aware that you have them), not being emotional in trades, never "falling in love" with a stock or position, and so on. And the use of capital is another huge one, if you bought a stock as it bounces off a support and you think it's going to make an upwards move but it doesn't and instead breaks through the support, you will have to sell anyways because you are disciplined and have a stop loss, but you will also not want to sit in a position you no longer have a thesis for why it will go up short term, and therefore your money can most likely be better off in another position. And if you can't find anything else that meets your predefined rigid trading criteria then you just hold cash until something does. Because capital is finite but opportunities are infinite.
</p>

<h3>Do your own research and make an educated decision based off of that.</h3>

<p>
All too often people are so blinded by their own beliefs, by the hype surrounding a particular asset, by clever marketing, or the charts that show no end in sight. Believing this hype is probably the most dangerous way to trade. People become so blinded by what they want to believe that they completely disregard the evidence that's sitting right in front of the.
</p>

<h3>There is no such thing as a shitcoin.</h3>

<p>
Period. Regardless of what everyone else says. There are scam coins, there are coins that don't have a good use model, there are coins that may not have the best whitepaper (or a white paper at all for that matter), but there is no such thing as a shitcoin. Every coin - other then scam coins which have zero purpose altogether, has a buying and a selling opportunity. People throw this term around for a number of reasons. Most of the time its because they don't like the coin, or they have heard something in the rumor mill that turned them off. Money is money. Regardless of what coin its made on.
</p>

<h3>Well first of all you need a systematic approach, also known as a trading system.</h3>

<p>
This is a framework which helps you define what you want to focus your attention on. Once you have this then you need to identify specific patterns which form in stocks. To actually find these patterns you can either manually look at charts (which can be very time consuming) or you can you use stock scanning software. I personally use an intraday stock scanner called Equityfeed which is a paid service. There are also end of day scanners (some are free and some paid), which can be used for swing trading.
</p>

<h3>I would never buy a coin like Tron because I believe it is weak.</h3>

<p>
The idea is brilliant. The use case model is fantastic. But it's team is weak, its whitepaper is lacking, and its CEO is a narcissist who cant stop talking about himself. Think a young version of Donald Trump without the business experience. Is there a buying opportunity? Absolutely. There have been a number of them for this coin. Was there money to be made in trading this coin? Absolutely. Money has been made. Would I hold it outside of a few days or a week? Never. I'd be setting a stop loss and monitoring it like a hawk and selling as soon as I've made a target return on it.
</p>

<h3>Don't day trade.</h3>

<p>
If you do, you need to do so with large amounts of crypto. This is extremely risky as there can be wild swings in an extremely short period of time. The Crypto Market isn't the Stock Market. Unlike regular stocks, a 60, 78, 80 or even 110% swing in a day is not uncommon in the Crypto world and this can happen in a matter of minutes. See point number 4 above. This can cost you big time unless you know what you're doing. Leave the day trading alone until you have a lot more experience. Either hold your assets long term, or try swing trading.
</p>

<h3>I strongly prefer swing trading as I don't have time to day trade.</h3>

<p>
At first I tried day trading, but after analysing why I lost money, I found out that due to not being behind my screen all the time. Had work, kids, the wife etc.<br>
So started to learn bout swing trading and found that this suits me better as I get to check with the markets when I have time.<br>
I enter orders and stoploss/target price levels. Usual time span for a trade ranges from 2-3h to 2 weeks. I don't usually touch the trades after entering into positions, as this allows me to stick to the initial plan.<br>
So to conclude I'd say make sure that your style fits your resources (time &amp; money)
</p>

<h3>Learn to control your emotions. Never trade with them.</h3>

<p>
 If you buy a coin and it starts to drop, don't panic sell. This is probably one of the top reasons people fail. Give it some time. But while you're giving it time research some more to find out why its dropping. You may have missed something. You may have just made a bad choice. But Chances are, the retraction is normal. Ride it out. Too many people buy a coin, it retracts and there is a loss. A panic sell is executes and low and behold, a reversal occurs and prices go up so you buy back in. There's a bunch of cash just thrown away. because you traded with emotion. Leave emotion at the door.
</p>

<h3>As a trader I look for specific patterns</h3>

<p>
Which I have found repeat day in and day out. When these patterns occur I take a position and I set specific risk parameters. In general I always try to day trade closing positions by the end of the day. So basically a stock has to do what I expect in a given time period. If it doesn't meaning it goes no place or goes against me, I have a set stop loss and I exit the stock for a predictable loss which falls within my predefined risk parameters. I don't care what happens after I get stopped out. All I care is to protect my trading capital. No specific trade is important. Only the combined amount of trades over several months or years is what I care about.
</p>

<p>
I did exactly that. Basically the catch is that over time you accumulate positions that are all moderately under water. Ie you run out of capital for day trading due to all the bag holding.<br>
It’s not a bad approach but has a limited lifespan in a sense
